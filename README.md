# Number-Guessing-Game

## Project Description

First, the program prompts the user to determine the upper limit of the range of numbers for the game. Then the program generates a random number in the range from 1 to the upper limit and asks the user to guess this number.  
If the user's guess is greater than a random number, the program displays the message 'Too high, try again'.  
If the guess is less than the random number, the program displays the message 'Too low, try again'.  
If the user guesses the number, the program congratulates him and displays the number of attemps.   
After this, the user chooses whether to continue the game or exit the program.
